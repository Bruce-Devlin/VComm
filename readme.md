# VCOMM

VCOMM is a voice recognition software used to assist in commanding units/AI in video games.

VCOMM allows you to set macros to voice commands that could give you an extra edge when playing your favorite games. VComm is an external application rather than a mod and so can be used on any program/app or game!

## Installation
Download VCOMM directly from the site [HERE](https://vcomm.publiczeus.com).
Once downloaded you can run the VComm.exe and boom, gaming is much cooler!

## Usage
VCOMM has a user-friendly UI that makes configuration and usage easy.

The ideal setup is a quiet place with a good quality* microphone without using the Push-To-Talk feature. 
### Objects
VComm makes use of several objects/classes to configure usage.
#### VPack
A VPack is a package of VRequests, this is used to save your configurations. (used primarily to save games)
```javascript
{
    "name": "Ready Or Not",
    "author": "Devlin",
    "vRequests": [{
            "phrases": [
                "red",
                "red team"
            ],
            "macro": {
                "msToWait": 0,
                "keycodes": [
                    "{F7}"
                ]
            }
        },
        {
            "phrases": [
                "blue",
                "blue team"
            ],
            "macro": {
                "msToWait": 0,
                "keycodes": [
                    "{F6}"
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
#### VRequests
A VRequest contains the Phrases that the VComm Voice Engine will recognize and the Macro that should be executed once any of the Phrases are recognized.

```javascript
{
    "vRequests": [{
            "phrases": [
                "red",
                "red team"
            ],
            "macro": {
                "msToWait": 0,
                "keycodes": [
                    "{F7}"
                ]
            }
        },
        {
            "phrases": [
                "blue",
                "blue team"
            ],
            "macro": {
                "msToWait": 0,
                "keycodes": [
                    "{F6}"
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
#### Macro
A Macro contains the Key Codes that are executed when the attached Phrase is recognized. It also allows for a ms delay to be added. (delay is awaited after each keycode has been sent.)

```javascript
{
    "macro": {
        "msToWait": 0,
        "keycodes": [
            "{F6}"
        ]
    }
}
```

Macro Key Codes can be any key contained within curly brackets (ie "{F}", "{Q}" "{/}) or plain names (ie "{CAPSLOCK}", "{DEL}" or "{DELETE}"). 
[Learn more about Key Codes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.sendkeys)

The ms delay is particularly useful in scenarios where the program loads, as each key press is consecutive (and non-concurrent/awaited) if we require a pause before executing the next key press we can apply it here.
